IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS ADDED:

1. ✅ Installation section now says:
   "That's it! Engram has zero runtime dependencies. Everything works out of the box."

2. ✅ Clear separation: "Optional Add-ons" section with:
   - "Install these ONLY IF YOU NEED THEM"
   - SQLite: "only if you need production-grade persistence"
   - Embeddings: "only if you need better semantic search"

3. ✅ Bold statement: "You can use Engram without installing any of these!"

4. ✅ Created ZERO_DEPS.md with complete guide on using Engram without any dependencies

KEY MESSAGE FOR USERS:
======================
npm install engram  → THAT'S ALL YOU NEED!

better-sqlite3? → OPTIONAL (only for SQLite storage)
embeddings? → OPTIONAL (only for better search)

Default storage (in-memory, JSON file) requires ZERO dependencies!
